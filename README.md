# Courtesies: 
This repository exists for nothing other than to keep an archive of the work that I have done and to demonstrate that work to employers. While I do not mind others looking at my work for a personal interest, I do not wish that others would replicate my work for sites and services that prohibit that behavior in their Usage Agreements.
